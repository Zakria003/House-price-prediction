# House Price Prediction: EDA, Feature Engineering, and Feature Selection

## Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and feature selection for a house price prediction dataset. The goal is to preprocess and prepare the data for predictive modeling by understanding the dataset, creating meaningful features, and selecting the most relevant features for modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lespin/house-prices-dataset) from Kaggle.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
``` <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <p>The project is organized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>train.csv</code>: The dataset used for analysis.</li>
        <li><code>eda_feature_engineering.ipynb</code>: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA, feature engineering, and feature selection processes.</li>
        <li><code>README.md</code>: This file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Missing Values:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Identified features with missing values.</li>
                <li>Analyzed the relationship between missing values and the target variable (<code>SalePrice</code>).</li>
                <li>Options considered: Drop or fill missing values based on their relation to <code>SalePrice</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Numerical Variables:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed the distribution and types of numerical variables (continuous vs. discrete).</li>
                <li>Analyzed temporal variables and their relation to house prices.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Categorical Variables:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed the cardinality of categorical variables.</li>
                <li>Evaluated their relationship with <code>SalePrice</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Outliers:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Identified and planned to handle outliers in continuous variables.</li>
                <li>Checked the skewness of continuous variables and planned transformations to handle non-Gaussian distributions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong> Replaced missing values with meaningful imputation based on their relationship with <code>SalePrice</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporal Features:</strong> Extracted useful features from date-related variables, such as the difference in years between the sale year and other date-related features.</li>
        <li><strong>Transformations:</strong> Addressed skewed distributions and outliers to make the data more suitable for regression modeling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Feature Selection</h2>
    <p>Used Lasso Regression with <code>SelectFromModel</code> for feature selection to identify the most important features. The model was configured with an alpha value of 0.005 to select features with non-zero coefficients.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The analysis and feature engineering led to a refined dataset with important features selected for modeling. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the <code>eda_feature_engineering.ipynb</code> notebook.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Download the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lespin/house-prices-dataset">Kaggle</a>.</li>
        <li>Place <code>train.csv</code> in the project directory.</li>
        <li>Open and run <code>eda_feature_engineering.ipynb</code> in Jupyter Notebook to replicate the analysis and feature engineering steps.</li>
    </ol>
